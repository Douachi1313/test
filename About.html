            <p>Evolution of the Starbucks Logo</p>

                <p>1971 <br>
                    Starbucks wasn’t always called Starbucks. The
                    original founders first named their company Pequod,
                    after the whaling ship in the story of Moby-Dick. They 
                    quickly realized this wasn’t a catchy name and switched 
                    it to Starbuck, who was the ship’s chief mate. It’s this naval 
                    theme that led them to their very first logo design of the twin-tailed mermaid.
                    In Greek mythology, these sirens (as they’re also called) would lure sailors into 
                    crashing their ships off the coast of small islands. The Starbucks logo would do the
                    same, except it would lure customers into buying tasty coffee. <br><br>

                    The first logo used a coffee brown color (earthly, stable, nurturing), 
                    and the mermaid was fully visible, holding her tail in both hands. The 
                    circular design allowed them to spin their company name around the logo, 
                    with the word’s coffee, tea, and spices—letting customers know what’s
                    available.</p>

                <!-- <img width="80" src="../Photo/logo1987.jpeg"> -->
                <p>1987 <br>
                    During this time, the company was bought by Howard Schultz, 
                    who wasted no time redesigning the logo. This would be the first  
                    evolution of the Starbucks logo. 
                    Schultz hired Terry Heckler, an artist, and designer to help with the new logo. 
                     Drawing inspiration from the port of Seattle and wanting to incorporate the idea 
                     of a fresh start and new opportunities to grow and succeed, Heckler made some big changes to the logo. <br><br>

                    The mermaid received a makeover. Her breasts were covered by her hair,
                    she kept her crown, and she became more streamlined. <br><br>
                    
                    The logo’s color transformed from brown to Kelly green to represent the company’s new purpose.
                    The words “tea” and “spices” were dropped as well. Instead, they created a new wordmark – Starbucks 
                    Coffee, with two stars connecting the words. <br><br>
                    
                    The stars’ use and placement helped the logo stand out and push its brand identity to be memorable and easy to recognize</p>

                    In 1992, Starbucks went through its third logo design change. The logo zoomed in on the mermaid,
                     creating a more intimate, close-up view. Her naval was no longer visible, and only some of her tail could be seen.
                    
                    
                    The font was also sharpened with a more professional and modern appearance. The result is a
                    logo with a cleaner look and feel, with the siren having a bigger impact and focus</p>

                    In 1992, Starbucks went through its thirCelebrating its 40th anniversary, 
                    the company decided to attempt a considerable rebranding effort. 

                    With a blast to the past, they reimagined the original 1971 logo with a  
                    few modern twists and changed the logo’s color from green to black. 
                    
                    
                    The result was a failure, and they received huge backlash from their customers. 
                    Their green branding and simple logo design had become so popular and familiar to  
                    the public, that their audience refused to accept anything other than the beloved green logo. 
                    
                    Just goes to show you how powerful the bond is between branding and your logo.</p>

                <p>2011 <br>
                    Realizing just how strong and successful their brand had become, Starbucks dropped 
                    many of the familiar design elements from its logo—giving it a very modern look and 
                    feel, with minimalism leading the charge. 
                    
                    
                    They said goodbye to the wordmark, stars, and outer ring. The logo now focused entirely 
                    on the siren, which they enlarged and gave a facelift. Her eyes, nose, and hair were 
                     redesigned to be more symmetrical, and they brought back the iconic green background color. 
                    
                    Starbucks explained that this latest approach allows the logo to 
                     appeal and connect with audiences worldwide</p>
